# LeetCode

Repository for solutions of tasks from LeetCode :D.

Some may ask 'Why Python?', for me answer is simple. Python in my opinion is best programming language to train algorithmic skills.
The simplicity of implementing ideas really helps to understand the problem and ways for solving problems (like divide and conquer).

Ofcourse implementing algorithms in Python has some drawbacks like:
- slow execution time 
- some problems are already solved by the language 
yet the most importat is finding solution to the problem, and implementation is on second place.
